## Workshop Mod
Mod available on [steam workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2163084841).

## Contributing
Load up the mod in tabletop simulator, and replace the existing script with your changes.

I recommend using [this atom plugin](https://atom.io/packages/tabletopsimulator-lua) that interfaces directly with the game - it makes script editing much more usable.
